### ðŸš€ About Me

<p align="left">
  I'm currently on an exciting journey with <strong>ALX</strong> as a <strong>Front-End Web Development</strong> learner.<br><br>
  I got into web development because I believe in the power of tech to **tell stories, solve real-world problems, and create opportunities**. Iâ€™m especially drawn to projects that are people-centered, beautiful, and make a difference.<br><br>
  What inspires me most is **helping women discover their potential through technology**. Whether it's showcasing women-led businesses, creating platforms that educate, or tools that connect â€” I'm here for it. I believe coding is not just about screens and syntax, but about creating real change, especially for women and girls across Africa.

### ðŸŽ¯ My Vision

ðŸ’¡ My dream is to **build digital spaces that empower women** â€” platforms where they can learn, grow, share, and thrive.<br>
ðŸ’» Iâ€™d love to work on projects like **online mentorship platforms for young women, resource hubs for female entrepreneurs, and websites that amplify the voices of African women in tech**.
